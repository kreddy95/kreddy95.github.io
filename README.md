### My First Computer Science Class

  Going into my first computer science class I never would have expected to go as far as I have with it.  I took 
COMP115 - Robots, Games, and Problem Solving, the second semester of my freshman year of college with Professor 
Armstrong.  Most people in my class were only taking the class as a connection or because they needed a 
quantitative analysis class to complete their degree.  I had another reason in mind for taking the class, my 
original purpose was only since the math department would consider the class as a two hundred level math class 
towards a Mathematics major, which was what I was leaning towards at the time.  Going into the class I knew 
nothing about what we were learning, using computers is something we’ve been being taught since the first grade 
but learning how to program in a computer language was a whole other world. 

  I don’t exactly remember the first day of the class besides sitting across from my preceptor, who was the only 
person I recognized in the class.  Class time was mostly spent with the professor showing us stuff on the 
computer and typing code into the command prompt or PowerShell which we then typed on our own computers.  A 
majority of the time I didn’t understand what was happening so I tried to save it on the screen or open another 
application so I could go back to it and it wouldn’t disappear.  This was my first class where everything was 
done on the computer, there were hardly ever any written notes on the board but I still tried to write down as 
much as I could or whatever I understood at the moment.  

  We used Codecademy to help us learn the basics of python, which was very helpful since it gives you information
about the syntax and different lessons about how it works.  Throughout the semester there were long nights of 
lying on my dorm room floor trying to figure out the different projects or labs and getting all kinds of errors
and different bugs that I didn’t know how to fix or if it was even possible to fix them.  Which at that point 
Google wasn’t even that helpful since any response I got from it made almost absolutely no sense to me seeing as 
I didn’t know or understand most of what it was saying.     

  At that point I never would have guessed that I would have loved it and would end up making computer science my 
second major.  I did not know what I was getting myself into when I chose to take the class but there was 
something about it that I just had to continue.
